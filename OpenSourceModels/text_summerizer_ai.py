Abdul Kalam, born in 1931 in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, was an Indian aerospace scientist and the 11th President of India (2002â€“2007) known for his pivotal role in India's space and missile programs, which earned him the titles 'Missile Man of India' and 'People/'s President'. He served as Project Director for India's first indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle and led the development of the AGNI and PRITHVI missiles before becoming President. Kalam, a vegetarian and devout Muslim, rose from humble origins to become an inspirational figure, dedicating his life to science and education until his passing in 2015."
